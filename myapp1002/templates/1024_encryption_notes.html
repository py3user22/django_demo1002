    <p>
        #____ Cyptography techniques   <br>--------------------<br>
        Encryption <br>----------------<br>
        converts plain text into cyphertext, which can only be decoded by the intended receiver<br>
        cipher --> mathematical formula that transforms plaintext into ciphertext<br>
        <br>
        Symmetric <br>
        uses the same key to encrypt & decrypt data.  <br>
        both sender/recipient have identical copies of key. <br>
        Cipher text --> data is encrypted into cypher text, meaning no1 can read or understand w/o key <br>
        <br>
        Asymmetric <br>-- aka public key cryptography-------------<br>
        type of encryption that uses a pair of keys to encrypt/decrypt data <br>
        sender uses the recipients <em>public key</em> to encrypt the data<br>
        public key is available to anyone <br>
        only the private key is used to unlock the messages<br>
        recipient uses the <b>private key</b> to decrypt it<br>

        <br>
        eliminates the need to exchange secret keys<br>
        ex1.<br>
        RSA<br>Diffy Hellman<br>ECC (Elliptic curve cryptography)<br><br>

    <h3>DES (date encryption standard)</h3>
    <p>
        #____ types:  DES (symmetric)  <br>
        breaks plain text input into 64 bit blocks to encrypt<br>
        starts w/ IP (initial permutation)<br>
        |_> splitting the block into LPT (left plain text) | IP | RPT (right plain text)<br>
        |__> each having 16 rounds of encryption --> LPT @ 16 + RPT @ 16<br>
        |___> rejoining the FP (final permutaion) to make the 64 bit cipher text <br>
        <br>
        DES uses a 64 bit key to encrypt these block w/ each 8 bits called parity bits used to check for errors in cypher text<br>
